# Setup and Installation Guides

This repository is a collection of guides and manuals for setting up systems, tools, and environments. It is designed to streamline installation processes and provide quick references for configurations. These setups reflect my personal preferences and workflows and are tailored to fit my needs and practices.

## Contents
- **Ubuntu**: Setup guides and configurations for Ubuntu-based systems.
- **Development Tools**: Configurations and setup for Python, Docker, Git, and more.

## How to Use
Browse the appropriate directory based on your platform or the tool you want to configure. Each guide contains step-by-step instructions and useful commands. While these configurations are crafted for my specific use cases, you're welcome to use them as references or adapt them to suit your own setup.
